                <h2>Ethics</h2>
                <p>
                The rise of big data, and consequently the introduction of new types of data sources and research directions, has raised numerous complex ethical questions spanning the entire research process, ranging from data collection (e.g., private vs public data, linking data across various sources), to data annotation and operationalization of variables (e.g., assigning social categories such as race and gender), to the development of NLP representations and methods that might encode human bias (e.g., word embeddings and machine translation), leading to the potential dissemination of harmful and erroneous information (e.g. through the reinforcement of stereotypes).

                <h2>Computational methods for theory building and explanation</h2>
                <p>
                In the social sciences and the humanities, researchers seek to understand a social or cultural phenomenon. Statistical models are mostly used to support their understanding and for theory building and testing. In natural language processing, however, the dominant focus is on building models that are effective on prediction tasks. Underlying objectives drive the selection and validation of models. As machine learning models are becoming increasingly complex and are often seen as black boxes, we are possibly moving even further away from using NLP/ML for theory building and explanation.

                    <h2>Data bias</h2>
                <p>
               While big social and cultural datasets offer many opportunities to study social and cultural phenomena, the datasets are often less controlled compared to more traditional datasets. They often contain unknown or not well understood biases and as a result, models and findings could be confounded, leading to low interpretability and limited justification for generalization to other domains. 
               </p><p>
                First, the datasets might contain content created by people who are very different from the general population. The uncontrolled nature of the data makes it challenging to obtain information about the social backgrounds of the content creators and therefore to account for these biases. Second, the focus on different data sources is not well balanced. For example,  social media studies often focus on individual data sources, and in particular Twitter. The dominance of Twitter is described by <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.7400.pdf"> Tufekci (2014)</a> as Twitter being the ‘model organism’ for social media studies. This is problematic however, since the design of social media platforms affects user behavior at all levels, e.g., leading to differences in language use and network structures. Third, even when focusing on a single data source, biases might be introduced due to the sampling method (e.g. by focusing on geotagged tweets (<a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D15-1256">Pavalanathan and Eisenstein, 2015</a>)).

                <h2>Interdisciplinary research</h2>
                <p>
                Research in this area is inherently interdisciplinary. As argued by <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0362331997900513">Nissani (1997)</a>, interdisciplinary research has the potential to lead to creative breakthroughs and to prevent cross-disciplinary oversights and disciplinary cracks (e.g., neglecting important research problems that do not fall within disciplinary boundaries). But doing interdisciplinary research is accompanied by various challenges, such as finding suitable publication venues, acquiring funding, and the impact on research evaluation.
