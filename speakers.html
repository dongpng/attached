His research examines how representation occurs in American politics using new statistical methods. His first book Representational Style in Congress: What Legislators Say and Why It Matters shows how senators define the type of representation they provide constituents and how this affects constituents' evaluations and won the Fenno Prize from the legislative studies section.  His second book The Impression of Influence: How Legislator Communication and Government Spending Cultivate a Personal Vote demonstrates how legislators ensure they receive credit for government actions.
